Smart Phone Based Self Service Kiosk (May 2016)

Description - A common problem that all of us face whenever we’re at a burger joint, or a pizza outlet, or any other fast food restaurant joints, is that we have to wait in long standing queues to wait for our turn to order. And that’s not it, even after ordering, we have to wait for long before our order is processed and ready to be served. 

Problems with the current (traditional) approach
1. Only one person stands in the queue and that person is responsible for remembering the order for everyone in the family or friends. This isn't a good approach as to err is human.

2. It doesn't feel right to stand in queues and order. In a traditional restaurant, the whole family or group of friends, decide their individual order and tell it to the waiter, without moving from their table.

3. Because there is a lot of noise (Background music in the restaurant, people chattering and laughing, etc.), there might be a possibility (and it might have happened with you some or the other time) that the guy on the counter might have heard you wrong and ordered something different from what you had said.

The purpose of this project is to eliminate all of these demerits from the current system and transform it in sync with the 21st century business model to make it as convenient as possible for the consumer and at the same time making it profitable for the businesses by automating the process of placing an order and increase in revenue by reduced workforce.
